          # WORKAROUND: Explicitly setting channelId to 'live' because the action
          # seems to be incorrectly trying to deploy to a channel even for the main branch,
          # and then requiring a channelId. 'live' is the default channel for your main site.
          channelId: live
          # Do NOT include 'expires: 7d' here, as it's a permanent live deployment.
